While many programs maintain their own unique brand identities, the Standards offer a common visual style that you can flexibly apply to a range of government digital platforms. Our visual style offers a clean, modern aesthetic that meets high standards of visual accessibility while promoting credibility, trust, and warmth in the design.

We expect many teams will need to customize this guide, but we encourage you to incorporate as much consistency in look, feel, and usability as you can.

As a complement to this visual style guidance, we strongly recommend you use 18F’s Content Guide when writing language for government services.

## Design resources<a id="design-resources"></a>

The site contains HTML mockups of common UI components designed to follow the Draft U.S. Web Design Standards' visual style guide. To view the specs of each design live on this website (padding, margins, stroke weight, line-height, and so on), use your browser’s developer tools.

## Notes on accessibility<a id="notes-on-accessibility"></a>

All of our designs meet the [WCAG 2.0 AA accessibility guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) and are compliant with [Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act](http://www.section508.gov/). If you choose to customize these designs, please make sure they continue to meet the requirements listed in the “Accessibility” section of each design.
