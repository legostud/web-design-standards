<p class="usa-font-lead">We’ve categorized our work into four themes:</p>

<ul class="usa-content-list usa-font-lead">
  <li>Deciding to use the Standards</li>
  <li>Working with the Standards</li>
  <li>Giving back (contributing) to the Standards</li>
  <li>Using a federal website that incorporates the Standards as a member of the public</li>
</ul>

## Deciding to use the Standards

Decision makers, designers, and developers want to know if the Standards will work for their projects.

- Decision makers, designers, and developers want to know if the Standards will work for their projects.
- A public, up-to-date product road map.
- UI components are comprised of clean, semantic code.
- The Standards offer core set of common, usable web components.
- Deciders and implementers want to see case studies so they can assess whether it will work for their project.
- Deciders want to know that they can customize the standards to fit their agency's brands and needs. Implementers want to be able to do this easily.

Decision makers, designers, and developers want to know how the Standards will be maintained.

- A public maintenance plan.
- Guidance on how to manage updates to the standards in individual projects.
- Contract managers want to know how to include use of the Standards in their contracts.
- Boilerplate language to include in government contracts.

## Working with the Standards

Designers and developers need to be able to get started quickly.

- A bare-bones HTML starter page, with CSS and JS pre-linked and necessary tags and classes.
- Simple "Getting Started" process and instructions.
- Ready to go HTML templates (and related design stencils) for common types of government site pages.
- Ability to quickly copy/paste code from the website.
- Design stencils and assets.
- A starter project representing a simple, static site with a few common pages.

Designers and developers want to know where to go for help.

- Defined processes for active and public implementer support.
- Concise, focused documentation that is easy to find but out of the way.

## Giving back

Contributors want to know how to share their suggestions for improving the Standards.

- Contribution guidelines for both designers and developers.

## General public

Members of the public want easy-to-use forms and interactions.

- Form patterns that include recommendations for just-in-time instructions.
- Form templates structured in short chunks.
- Form patterns that allow for easy recovery of mistakes.
- Interaction patterns for "Save as you go" functionality.
- Way-finding components, such as progress indicators.

Non-native English speakers want to be able to read and understand the content.

- Language toggle and other web components related to multilingual sites.
- Website chrome in Spanish.
